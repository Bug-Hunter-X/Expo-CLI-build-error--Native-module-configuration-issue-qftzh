# Expo CLI Build Error: Native Module Configuration Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Expo projects that utilize native modules. The problem arises from incomplete or incorrect configurations for iOS and Android, causing build failures.  The `bug.js` file shows example code that may cause this issue, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution.

## Problem

The error manifests during the build process, reporting issues with native module linking or missing required files.  The exact error message can vary depending on the specific module and platform.  The issue typically stems from discrepancies between the native module's implementation and the Expo project's configuration. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring complete and correct configurations for both iOS and Android platforms. This includes proper linking of the native modules and providing all necessary files within the respective platform directories. The `bugSolution.js` provides a more robust configuration approach.
