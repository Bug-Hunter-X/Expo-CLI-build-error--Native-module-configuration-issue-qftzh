The solution depends on the specific native module, but generally involves verifying the configuration in `ios/` and `android/` directories.   Ensure that all necessary native dependencies are installed and correctly linked in your project's respective platform configurations. This often entails verifying the module's installation instructions and confirming the presence of any required files, such as header files (.h) or library files (.a, .so). Example steps:

1. **Check Native Module Documentation**: Review the native module's documentation for platform-specific installation and configuration instructions.
2. **Verify Package.json:** Ensure that the native module is properly listed in your project's `package.json` file and that its dependencies are installed.
3. **Check ios/Podfile:** If the module requires CocoaPods, ensure the Podfile is configured properly for both iOS and Android.
4. **Check android/build.gradle:** Ensure the module's dependencies are properly included in the Android `build.gradle` file.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making changes, run `expo prebuild` to refresh the build cache, and then `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`.
